# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe is played on an empty 3x3 field. Player O places the circles and player X places the crosses. Starting with the player with the cross, players take turns selecting empty squares and drawing their marks inside. The player wins when he achieves 3 of his symbols consecutively in a row, column, main or side diagonal.
